## 1000WAT website

[1000WAT](http://1000wat.com.au) is a Thai food restaurant based in Melbourne's
CBD. I created a new website for 1000WAT with a focus on responsive design and
simple content management. Ruby on Rails was used on the server-side, with
jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap providing a good client-side user experience.

<div class="mobile-frame" style="width: 20%; float:left;">
